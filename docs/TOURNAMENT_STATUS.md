- King Safety: 4.0 (defensive awareness)
- Attack/Defense: 3.5 (balanced aggression)
- Mate Threats: 6.0 (finishing ability)
- Piece Coordination: 3.0 (teamwork)

**Fitness Modifications**:
- Max Moves per Game: 150 (prevents endless games)
- Mutation Rate: 0.12 (moderate evolution speed)
- Tournament Size: 5 (selection pressure)

## What Happens Next

### Phase 1: Training Completion (Current - ~11:30 AM)
1. **Monitor Progress**: Use `python monitor_tournament_training.py`
2. **Expected Completion**: Around 11:30 AM (2.5 hours from start)
3. **Final Model**: Will be saved as `best_gpu_model_gen_232.pth` (approx)

### Phase 2: Engine Packaging (~11:30 AM - 12:00 PM)
1. **Run Packaging**: `python package_tournament_engine.py`
2. **Creates Tournament Package**: Complete UCI-compatible engine
3. **Includes**:
   - Tournament-optimized AI wrapper
   - Time management system
   - Arena Chess GUI integration files
   - Setup instructions and documentation

### Phase 3: Arena Integration (12:00 PM onwards)
1. **Install Engine**: Follow generated `ARENA_SETUP.md` instructions
2. **Test Matches**: Run quick 5+3 games against known engines
3. **Tournament Entry**: Set up Swiss tournaments or engine matches
4. **Data Collection**: Record results for analysis

## Tournament Package Contents

When training completes, the packaging system will create:
