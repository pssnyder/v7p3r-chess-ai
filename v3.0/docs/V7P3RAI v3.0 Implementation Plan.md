- Threat analysis (attack counts, control)
- Material balance and piece counts
- Pawn structure metrics
- King safety analysis
- Game phase calculation
- Tactical pattern detection

# Individual Piece Features (32 pieces × ~20 dimensions = 640)
- Piece type, color, position
- Mobility metrics (legal moves, attacks)

```

## **🚀 Implementation Strategy**

### **Development Approach**
1. **Build incrementally** - Each phase builds on previous
2. **Test continuously** - Validate each component independently
3. **GPU-first design** - Optimize for CUDA from start
4. **Pure autonomy** - No human chess knowledge injection
5. **Performance focused** - Target real-time gameplay

### **Key Principles**
- **Zero human bias** - Let AI discover everything
- **Rich metadata** - Extract every objective measure possible
- **Real-time capable** - Must work in tournament conditions
- **Self-improving** - Learning never stops
- **Autonomous discovery** - No guidance on what makes good chess

## **📝 Development Notes**

### **Current Status** (Phase 1 Complete)
- ✅ ChessState data model implemented
- ✅ Metadata extraction system built
- ✅ Feature vector foundation ready
- 🚧 Ready for Phase 2: Thinking Brain development

### **Next Immediate Steps**
1. Design GRU neural network architecture
2. Implement feature vector conversion
3. Create move candidate generation system
4. Test Thinking Brain with simple positions

### **Risk Mitigation**
- **Computational cost**: Use efficient GPU implementations
- **Training convergence**: Monitor every 1000 games, adjust if needed
- **Real-time performance**: Profile and optimize critical paths
- **Integration complexity**: Test components individually first

## **🎯 Success Definition**
The v3.0 engine will be considered successful when it:
1. **Wins consistently** against traditional engines
2. **Develops unique style** through autonomous discovery
3. **Performs in real-time** for all target time controls
4. **Shows continuous improvement** through self-play
5. **Discovers novel patterns** not present in human chess theory
