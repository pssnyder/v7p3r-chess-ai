# V7P3R Chess AI v3.0 (Experimental)

Experimental branch for testing new approaches and architectures.

## Status
**Experimental** - This version is for testing new ideas that may or may not be incorporated into future releases.

## Purpose
This version allows safe experimentation with:
- Alternative neural network architectures
- New training methodologies
- Different evaluation approaches
- Novel chess AI concepts

## Development
This branch can evolve independently of v2.0, allowing for:
- Risk-free experimentation
- Comparison with v2.0 approaches
- Potential integration of successful features

## Note
If experiments prove unsuccessful, development can continue from v2.0 → v4.0, skipping v3.0 entirely.

## Getting Started
This is a clean slate for experimentation. You can:
1. Copy v2.0 as a starting point
2. Start fresh with new architecture
3. Implement alternative approaches

## Ideas for v3.0 Experimentation
- Transformer-based chess models
- Reinforcement learning approaches (A3C, PPO)
- Monte Carlo Tree Search integration
- Hybrid symbolic-neural approaches
- Multi-agent training environments
